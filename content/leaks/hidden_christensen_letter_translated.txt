Dear Maria,

All is lost. Jorgensen will take over me as the president of the People's Party. They won't ask me to leave my position, they will want me to voluntarily resign soon.

You were right. They won't let a lagrmann into the government. They don't want old Havlandic in their modern republic.

I'm coming back to Copenhagen. It's cold.
